> # **Fantasium Rec Room Cheat**
Made by neptune#1995 and fanta_foxx#9547. This was made public due to a member of Orangutang Operation getting token logged & this getting leaked. I have no plans on maintaining or updating this repo. This cheat changes local permissions to allow flying, invention spawning, and partial use of Maker Pen.
